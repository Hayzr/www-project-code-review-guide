Welcome to the official repository for the Secure Code Review Guide. The Secure Code Review Guide is a comprehensive guide that aids software developers in reviewing code for security vulnerabilities and security bugs. 

We are currently working on a new release (3.0), and our project is open for contributions. Have a look at the [discussion folder](https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-code-review-guide/blob/master/discussion/vision-and-roadmap.md) to see how the project is shaping up and read about the roadmap and vision.

## How to contribute

The new release of the secure code review guide has just started, and as such, it's a fantastic time to join us and help shape the latest version. We welcome your contributions, whether you have a lot or just minimal experience in software engineering, security, or IT. We are happy to help you get started. Similarly, if you have a lot or just a little time at your hand, there are plenty of opportunities to help with this project. 

Here are a few ways you can help:

- Please help us fix any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors in the current draft.
- The code review guide is only available in English, but it would be great if you could help translate it to another language.
- We have a list of open issues from which you can pick one to work on and submit a pull request. If you need help with getting started, please [get in touch](#get-in-touch).
- Finally, if you have an excellent idea for improving the code review guide, you can also open a new issue yourself.
