# Vision and Roadmap of The OWASP Code Review Guide



[TOC]

## Who is this Code Review Guide For

The code review guide is directed at software developers and development teams that want to strengthen their ability to detect security vulnerabilities and security bugs right during continuous software development. The code review guide plays a crucial part in an organization's desire and effort to shift security left. Instead of waiting for dedicated security professionals to inspect the software periodically, this guide helps software developers integrate security-focused thinking and secure code reviews into their daily work. 

## How to work with the Code Review Guide

The secure code review guide comes in the form of a PDF-booklet and can also be viewed online as a webpage. It is lightweight (e.g., shorter than 30 pages), covers the essential aspects of the code review process, and comprises a code review checklist that highlights which aspects developers should consider during code review. The guide also references other necessary resources to help the developers deepen their understanding, but it does not repeat them. 

## Outline of the Guide

### Part 1: Secure Code Review Process

This part of the guide highlights how code reviews, especially reviews focusing on security aspects of the software, can be integrated into a continuous software development process. 

Part 1 of the guideline is relevant for teams or organizations that do not have secure code reviews as part of their development or code review process or want to re-evaluate and optimize their operations.

We envision that part 1 of this guideline is initially consulted by developers and teams but becomes less relevant as their processes mature and settle.

### Part 2: Secure Code Review Checklist

Part 2 of the secure code review guide comprises an actionable checklist, which should become the go-to reference for software developers while reviewing code for security aspects. We envision teams using this part as a reference or handbook during daily code reviews and for training and education purposes. 



## Changes with regard to version 2.0

- Reduce the lengths drastically (from 218 to less than 30 pages)

- Reduce duplications (such as repeating content that is better covered by other OWASP projects)

- Make sure all sources of information or trustworthy and mentioned in the guide.
