## Who Should Use This Guide?
The primary audience for this guide is software developers who understand that to produce secure code, quality and safety responsibilities have to be part of their daily work.

Instead of transferring these responsibilities and relying on security professionals who do not have intimate knowledge of their work, security-conscious developers have to independently find and fix problems in the code they produce.

Whether the reader is just starting to learn about security or a security expert, we hope this guide will help decide :
the most appropriate type of code review for an organization,
where to look for code with security implications, 
and what to look for to find security vulnerabilities.

This guide is not meant to be read from cover to cover. Instead, it was conceived with the idea that it would live at arm's length from the developer's desk as a helpful reference guide.
